# MemoryLeakTester

This program tests MXK-F 219 provisioning for memory leaks.

WARNING:

MXK-F bulk provisioning is extremely slow (especially my test, 1024 ONUs). This program will take at least half an hour to complete 1 pass, making your 219 mostly unusable for that time period. Use at your own risk!
